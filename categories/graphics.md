# Moderating Graphic Contributions

**Reminder:** Please read the current [Utopian Rules](https://utopian.io/rules) first, to bring yourself up to date.

[Graphics](https://utopian.io/graphics/review) category hasn't got much formal and strict rules but requires formal language. Graphics category  includes logo, video/motion intros for open source projects. Those all have to be either improvements or never existed before. Low quality, less informative contributions shouldn't be accepted.

Graphic contributions,
- Should follow the template provided by Utopian
- Should be linked to correct repository
- Should be in formal language
- Should have a descriptive text about project
- Should have a desctiptive text about design's purpose and process
- Should have a desctiptive text about improvements and benefits
- Should have screenshots/gifs/videos to proove that work done by author
- Should have publicly accessible (editable and ready to use) files
- Should have information about tools used -e.g., illustrator, photoshop, sketch
- Should have links/information for used materials -e.g., font, background images, mock-up files
- ...


## Rules
- This category is meant only for graphics/videos/motion graphics that you have realised for an open source project.
- The contribution must be a direct result of your own work. It is strictly prohibited to modify other people’s work/assets or use a template and claim it as yours.
- T-shirts and merchandising are generally not valid contributions in Utopian.
- You must include every possible detail in your contributions to verify the work is done by you.
- A contribution must contain the final file of your work, sample of the work, applications of your work, comparison to the existing product, and benefits of your work to the project owner.
- Graphics contributions can be delivered in .psd, .ai, .cdr or any other universally accepted file format except logo designs. Those must be delivered in a vector file (e.g. .eps/.svg/.pdf) for flexibility and scalability, and .png file format.
- Logo design contributions must contain the actual logo (logomark/logotype), the logo in a form of an icon, logo variations in terms of size and colour (monochrome and full-colour versions). You can see some examples of good contributions here, here, and here.
- Any text or fonts must be converted into shapes or “outlined”.
- You must provide credit to all third-party images/assets you have used in your contribution and make sure that you have permission to use them for commercial use. (images, videos, fonts, 3D models etc.)
- Intro videos are acceptable only if the project has already had an intro video before and your contributed video is of a better quality.
- It is highly recommended that you promote your work to the project owner.
- Banners, header images and other assets for use on social media platforms are not valid contributions at the moment.
- Designs are preferred to be in a vector format unless the project owner specifies a different format.

Not respecting the rules will either give you lower votes or your contribution won't be accepted.

## Format

### Process / Proof of work
Every graphic contribution requires screenshots from process to avoid plagiarism.

### One color
Every graphic contribution requires one color version of design, this is for visibility and see if it is remarkable and understandable without effects, also some projects may need it for printing purposes.

### Color Variations
Coloring is another important subject. Every color has own meanings. Therefore projects may require friendly or strong impacts, which can be given by colors.

### Size variations
Logos or application icons should be usable as favicon, menubar icon or notification icon aswell so size alternatives should be presented.
