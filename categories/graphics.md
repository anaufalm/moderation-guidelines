# Moderating Graphic Contributions

**Reminder:** Please read the current [Utopian Rules](https://utopian.io/rules) first, to bring yourself up to date.

[Graphics](https://utopian.io/graphics/review) category hasn't got much formal and strict rules but requires formal language. Graphics category  includes logo, video/motion intros for open source projects. Those all have to be either improvements or never existed before. Low quality, less informative contributions shouldn't be accepted.

Graphic contributions,
- Should follow the template provided by Utopian
- Should be linked to correct repository
- Should be in formal language
- Should have a descriptive text about project
- Should have a descriptive text about design's purpose and process
- Should have a descriptive text about improvements and benefits
- Should have screenshots/gifs/videos to prove that work done by author
- Should have publicly accessible (editable and ready to use) files
- Should have information about tools used -e.g., illustrator, photoshop, sketch
- Should have links/information for used materials -e.g., font, background images, mock-up files
- ...

## Format

### Process / Proof of work
Every graphic contribution requires screenshots from process to avoid plagiarism.

### One color
Every graphic contribution requires one color version of design, this is for visibility and see if it is remarkable and understandable without effects, also some projects may need it for printing purposes.

### Color Variations
Coloring is another important subject. Every color has own meanings. Therefore projects may require friendly or strong impacts, which can be given by colors.

### Size variations
Logos or application icons should be usable as favicon, menubar icon or notification icon, so size alternatives should be presented.

### Logotype
Logotype should be presented in vertical and horizontal positioning.

### Comparison
Proposed logo design should be compared to old one, side by side to show the improvements.
