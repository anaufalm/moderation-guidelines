# This is a file containing all of our current teams, their specialisations as well as the supervisors handling them.
The categories are in order of specialisation, but the order of supervisors is random. The main category is always first, and the sub-categories follow. Moderators are welcome to review other categories, to get enabled in them, they should contact a supervisor that supervises one of these categories (preferably as a main category).

Every supervisor has got it's own, unique main category that is not shared with other supervisors, unless one of them is supervising the Lead-Team (see teams E and F).

# Management:
The management is currently handled by **elear** with **arie.steem** & **espoem** as his overseers.


# Creative & Development:

These teams require specialists to review them and should be split into as few categories as possible to avoid inconsistent reviews. As so, in these teams, no categories other than **Bug Hunting** repeats itself.

# Language and How-Tos:

Translations, Tutorials and Video-Tutorials make up the most of all contributions on utopian. As so, multiple teams are required to handle them in order to avoid massive downtimes. Also, as Tutorials and Video-Tutorials allow the users to contribute in their mother-tongue, it was important to match these categories to a team that already handles Translations.
